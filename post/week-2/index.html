<p>This week has slowed down a little bit. It is more a research week,I wasn&rsquo;t able to do what I thought I would do, like working on <code>hoodie</code> because I just realized I might have even better ways to achieve my goals.</p>

<h1 id="work">Work</h1>

<p>No PR was submitted to the <code>tyk</code> gateway this week, however I have been onto some cool stuff that might prove useful to the gateway someday.</p>

<p>So, I was researching on a benchmarking solution for the gateway. The main criteria of the solution was</p>

<ul>
<li>configurable (should be a ble to rune different parameters like environments/configurations etc)</li>
<li>simple to reason about and implement</li>
<li>detect regressions on new changes commits/pr&rsquo;s</li>
</ul>

<p>I have made  quiet a progress on this, probably I might have a prototype by next week. I can&rsquo;t talk much about it because its still experimental and lots of moving pieces.</p>

<h1 id="private">Private</h1>

<p>I took a look on <code>hoodie</code> , especially the <code>unicode</code> module which is a port the go <code>unicode</code> package. I think it is bloated, because it duplicates what zig already offers on the standard library and to some extent differs for instance in zig a code point is <code>u32</code> but in <code>hoodie</code> it is <code>132</code>.</p>

<p>I initially ported Nim&rsquo;s <code>unicode</code> module. I was successful but realized it was so basic and lacked lots unicode related features, for instance its range tables are only limited to <code>UnicodeData.txt</code> file.</p>

<p>Then I remember reading about <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">quickjs</a> and its full unicode library written in C. So I took the liberty of studying what these people do with unicode. Also I have actually been reading the specification too to get more familiar with unicode so I will understand implementation.</p>

<p>My goal now is to port quickjs unicode library to zig.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This week has only been about research, Next week I will be picking what I let this week. On my spare time I will keep playing with unicode.</p>
