      <description>This week has slowed down a little bit. It is more a research week,I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to do what I thought I would do, like working on hoodie because I just realized I might have even better ways to achieve my goals.
Work No PR was submitted to the tyk gateway this week, however I have been onto some cool stuff that might prove useful to the gateway someday.</description>

      <description>Week 1 updates This is my first of many updates that I plan to write on weekly basis. The updates will cover what I have accomplished in a week. The focus is mainly on work and my open source contributions. This will alaso include any lessons I pick up on weekly basis.
What weekly updates should be about  should be about open source and my work ( I am currently working fulltime on an open source project tyk) should be brief and concise (These are not blog posts, they are like a notebook to keep tabs of whet I have been up to) should be about programming should end with what I plan or wish to work on the following week  Work It has been three months since I started working on tyk, so this is a recap of the work I have done in the past three months.</description>
